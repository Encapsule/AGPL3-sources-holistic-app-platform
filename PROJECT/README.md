# holodev/PROJECT/README.md

At the outermost level of the holistic platform is the holodev repo. The package.json here is used to set the platform revision etc.

The Makefile in the holodev repo uses the directories here as follows:

## PLATFORM

The PLATFORM directory contains scripts and assets for building the @encapsule/holistic platform distribution package containing appgen.

They are not copied into the @encapsule/holistic distribution package itself.

## GENERATOR

The contents of the GENERATOR directory is copied into the @encapsule/holistic platform distribution package generated by holodev/Makefile.

Subsequently, the appgen uses these files from within the @encapsule/holistic distribution package to customize its operation to the specific platform version/build when it is making changes to a derived app service repo.
